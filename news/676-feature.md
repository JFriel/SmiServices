Improvements to IsIdentifiable Reviewer
-   Tab based navigation
-   Better pattern generation for overlapping failure parts
-   Fixed sequential mode always showing failures covered by existing UPDATE rules
-   Fixed tree view not adapting as new rules are added e.g. when used to interactively process many failures
